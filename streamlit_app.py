        ### ðŸ§® How the Value Formula Works
        We want to see how much **value** a player provides compared to how much they're paid. So we use this formula:

        - We take the stat you care about (like Home Runs or WAR)
        - We give a small bonus for playing time (more games or innings played)
        - We divide that by how much money they make

        **The higher the score, the more performance you're getting for every dollar spent!**
